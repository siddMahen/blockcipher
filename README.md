# blockcipher

This is block cipher I built in an attempt to understand how to build block
ciphers.

## Build

This program requires the `GCC` compiler:

To build, run:

	make clean
	make

This will create an executable file called `blockcipher`.

# Usage

# Ideas and Stuff

IDEA encryption algorithm.
